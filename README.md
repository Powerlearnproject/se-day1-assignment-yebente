#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is the art of using design principles to develope, test and maintain a software systems.

<ins>Importance</ins>
1. Software engineering provides a career for the creative people who want to explore their creativity.
2. Software engineering helps in the developement of a reliable, efficient and easy to use software.
3. Software engineering creates solutions to common problems in the society like the application of smoke detectors to counter wild fires.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. The introduction of digital computers in between 1940s and 1950s
2. Developement of the first programming languages like C and Fortran in the 1960s
3. The introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1970s and 1980s
4. Introduction of the Agile methodologies in the 2000s

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
1. Gathering requirements for the software to be developed to help understand user requirements.
2. Designing the software based on user needs, budget and timeline.
3. Implementing the software after considering all requirements and functionality.
4. Testing the software for quality assurance purposes to ensure quality assurance standards are met before releasing it to the user.
5. Maintaining the software to ensure it works efficiently and smoothly.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
1. Waterfall methodology is a linear approach to software development where each phase is completed before moving to the next while in Agile, software developement stages are broken down to different groups both developed simulteniously.
2. Waterfall methodology is more appropriate for projects with a fixed scope, timeline and budget while Agil is approprieate for projects that with an undefined scope, timeline and a budget but open to the developer's creativity.

<ins>Examples</ins>
1. Example of a waterfal methodology is when developing a finacial application that need to be very secure from hacking. 
2. Example of an Agile methodology can be used when improving an already existing application like a social networking app with a very tight deadline.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
1. Software Developer: Responsible for developing the software, testing and debugging it.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for testing the software to ensure it meets the quality standards.
3. Project Manager: Responsible for managing the project timeline, budget and resources to ensure the project is completed on time and within deadline.


**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
1. IDEs: Helps in the development of the software by providing a platform for coding, testing like VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
2. VCS: Helps in the tracking of changes made to the software by different developers like Git, SVN, and Mercurial.


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
1. Software engineers are affected by changes in the original system requirements after the software developemnet process has started. 
2. Software engineers are affected by the lack of resources like time, budget and personnel.
3. Software engineers are affected by the lack of communication between team members.
4. Software engineers are affected by the lack of documentation of the software system.
5. Software engineers are affected by the lack of testing and debugging of the software system. 
6. Software engineers are affected by the lack of maintenance of the software system.

<ins>strategies to overcome these challenges</ins>
1. Communication between team members is key to overcome the lack of communication between team members.
2. Documentation of the software system is key to overcome the lack of documentation of the software system.
3. Testing and debugging of the software system is key to overcome the lack of testing and debugging of the software.
4. Maintenance of the software system is key to overcome the lack of maintenance of the software system.
5. Strict rules and agreemants before starting the developement process help bind both the client and developer to the end without adjusting the system requirements.

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Crafting and refining sets of instructions that are meant to be input in AI models to communicate a task that the AI need to execute.
Prompt engineering is important because it helps to improve the performance of AI models by providing them with clear and and detailed instructions to ensure the desired output.


**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
1. Vague prompt: "Create a story about a character who is a hero."
2. Improved prompt: "Create a 500-word story about a character named John who is considered a hero in the field or robotics because he developed graphical materials that children under the age of 5 can use to understand the logic of how algorithims and computer systems work. Show how his contribution in the society from 2000 has led to very manny young developers who have a strong mastery of the basics of computer programing helping them easily learn and adapt to new and upcoming technologies.
**Why the improved prompt is more effective**
1. The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear and specific instructions to the AI model.
2. It also provides context and background information that can help the AI model to better understand the task and generate the most appropriate description of a hero in a specific industry.
